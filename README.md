<div align = 'center';'><h1>Super Store Analysis</h1></div>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The dataset provided was sourced from <a href = \"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting\">Kaggle</a>. Initially, the dataset was intended to forecast the sales of next seven days, however I opted to simply do an extensive analysis of the dataset trying to find possible problems that can be extracted from the file. Below you will be able to see a discussion showing all the important insights I was able to obtain, and finally a more extensive discussion of my thought process going through the file.</p>
